#   Semestral work report B251
-   Implementation Language: **python/cpp**

##  Implementation and data structure design
-   What construction algorithm did you choose and why?
-   Did you need any additional computation to answer all of the queries for matching? If yes, what and how did you integrate it? 
-   Did you have any troubles you want to share with your implementation?

##  LCF Algorithm design
-   Describe and write pseudocode of your algorithm
-   Analyse time and memory consumption
-   Please, keep your variable name same as in implementation

##  Experiment results
-   Import your graphs from the experiments
-   How the pattern length and the number of occurences in the text inflict the query time?
-   Did you have any troubles you want to share with experiment running and evaluation?

##  Conclusion
-   For what kind of queries and data would you recommend Suffix Automaton data structure?
-   Can you just by your words compare SAM with other suffix data structures (Trie, Tree, Array?)
